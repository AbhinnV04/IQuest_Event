# IQuest_Event

## Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of machine learning, with hands-on exercises and projects to solidify your understanding. The workshop is divided into two main parts:

## Part One: Introduction to Machine Learning
In this section, we will cover:

Basics of Machine Learning: Understand what machine learning is, its types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning), and real-world applications.
Building a Simple Model: Participants will learn how to build a basic machine learning model using the Iris dataset. This includes:
Data preprocessing and exploration.
Implementing Logistic Regression.
Building a Single Unit Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
Hands-on Exercises: Participants will have the opportunity to experiment with the models, tweak parameters, and see how different changes affect the outcomes.
## Part Two: Advanced Model Building
In the second part of the workshop, we will focus on more complex models:

#### Cats vs. Dogs Dataset: Participants will learn to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the Cats vs. Dogs dataset.
Understanding Layers and Architectures: We will explore different types of layers (convolutional, pooling, dense, etc.) and how to design a neural network architecture.
## Exercises and Follow-ups: 
After building the model, participants will engage in exercises to apply their learning to the CIFAR-100 dataset. This will include:
- Experimenting with different architectures.
- Experimenting with hyperparameters
- Evaluating model performance.

#### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks and data handling.
#### Materials
- Datasets: Iris dataset, Cats vs. Dogs dataset, CIFAR-100 dataset.
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.
